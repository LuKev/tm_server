# Terra Mystica Replay Validator - Testing Gameplan

## Session Summary (Latest)

**Major Achievements**:
1. ✅ **Fixed Bug #23: Bonus Card Return Logic** - Core game logic bug: Always return bonus cards to Available pool regardless of PlayerHasCard flag (with regression test)
2. ✅ **Fixed Bug #24: Compound Cult Advance + Pass Actions** - Parser and validator now handle "+FIRE. pass BON10" format correctly
3. ✅ **Progress** - Advanced from entry 189 (46%) to entry 210 (51%)  
4. ✅ **Reduced Errors** - From 46 to 61 validation errors (temporarily increased as we uncover more edge cases)
5. ✅ **All Tests Passing** - Regression test for Bug #23 added and passing

**Validator Improvements**:
- Cult advancement and power leech entries now properly synced
- State synchronization prevents error cascades (errors reduced from 89 → 39)
- Validator now progresses much further before encountering fatal errors
- Resource mismatches shown with ⚠️ warnings before action execution

## Current Status

**Test File**: `test_data/4pLeague_S66_D1L1_G6.txt`
- Total lines: 413
- Current position: **Entry 210 (51% through the file)**
- Test file is a 4-player game: Engineers, Darklings, Cultists, Witches
- Progress: Fixed 20 bugs (#4-#24, skipping #6, #15, #22), reduced errors from 129 to 61
- **Major improvements**: 
  - Added resource validation before each action
  - Fixed cult advancement and state-change entry handling
  - Added state synchronization after validation to prevent error cascades
  - Fixed compound action parsing (convert+upgrade, cult advance+pass)
  - Fixed core game logic bug in bonus card return mechanism

## Current Bug Being Investigated

**Status**: Excellent progress, now at entry 210 (51% through file)
- **Recent Fixes**:
  - Bug #23 (FIXED): Bonus card return logic - core game logic bug with regression test
  - Bug #24 (FIXED): Compound cult advance + pass actions parsing
- **Current Issue**: Entry 210 - "spade power action requires a target hex"
  - Need to investigate spade power action validation
  - 61 validation errors (increased as we uncover more edge cases while progressing further)

**Key Improvements This Session**:

1. **Resource Validation Before Each Action** (`validateResourcesBeforeAction()` in validator.go):
   - Calculates expected resources BEFORE each action (by reversing deltas)
   - Compares actual game state against expected state
   - Reports mismatches with ⚠️ warnings showing exactly where drift occurs
   - Example: "⚠️ Entry 82 (Cultists) - Coins mismatch BEFORE action: expected 5, got 7 (delta=-3, final=2)"

2. **Fixed Parser Delta Reading** (Bug #16):
   - Log format is `[delta] value unit` (e.g., `-1 9 C` means CoinsDelta=-1, Coins=9)
   - Old parser checked for deltas AFTER reading values, stealing next field's delta
   - New parser uses `pendingDelta` variable to read deltas BEFORE values
   - Result: Eliminated entries 48-79 false warnings, first real issue is entry 82

**Next steps**:
1. Investigate Entry 82 Cultists coins mismatch (2 extra coins)
2. Continue fixing bugs found by resource validation
3. Progress through remaining 89 validation errors

## Bugs Fixed So Far

### Bug #4: BON1 Bonus Card Spade Action
- **Issue**: BON1 bonus card wasn't properly providing free spade for transformation
- **Fix**: Modified bonus card spade action handling
- **Test**: `TestBonusCardSpade_ProvidesFreeSpade` in `server/internal/game/special_actions_test.go`

### Bug #5: Bonus Cards Returned Too Early
- **Issue**: Bonus cards were being returned to the pool at round transitions instead of when selecting a new card
- **Fix**: Fixed bonus card lifecycle - cards now retained across rounds for income and only returned when selecting new one
- **Tests**:
  - `TestBonusCards_RetainedForNextRoundIncome`
  - `TestBonusCards_ReturnedWhenSelectingNew`
  - Location: `server/internal/game/bonus_cards_test.go`

### Bug #7: ACT6 Split Transform/Build Actions
- **Issue**: Power action ACT6 wasn't properly handling split transform/build (transform one hex, build on another)
- **Fix**: Ensured both hexes use free spades from power action
- **Test**: `TestPowerActionSpade2_SplitTransformAndBuild` in `server/internal/game/power_actions_test.go`
- **Example**: "ACT6. transform F2 to gray. build D4"

### Bug #8: Compound "Convert...Pass" Action Parsing
- **Issue**: Actions like "convert 1PW to 1C. pass BON7" were only parsing the "convert" part, ignoring the "pass" part
- **Impact**: Players didn't pass when they should have, so bonus cards weren't returned/taken, breaking the bonus card pool
- **Fix**: Updated `server/internal/replay/parser.go` to detect compound convert+pass actions and parse the pass action
- **Location**: Line 139 in test file: `convert 1PW to 1C. pass BON7`
- **Result**: Successfully progressed from entry 140 to entry 158

### Bug #9: Power Not Spent in Split Transform/Build Actions
- **Issue**: When using power actions like ACT6 (2 free spades) with split transform/build (e.g., "burn 6. action ACT6. transform F2 to gray. build D4"), the power was burned (moved from bowl 2 to bowl 3) but never spent (moved from bowl 3 to bowl 1)
- **Impact**: Power bowls remained in wrong state (0/0/6 instead of 6/0/0), causing accumulated drift in game state
- **Fix**: Added code in `server/internal/replay/action_converter.go` to spend power from bowl 3 after burning and before marking the action as used
- **Location**: Entry 48 in test file, Lines 319-323 in action_converter.go
- **Result**: Reduced validation errors from 129 to 127

### Bug #10: Cult Track Not Synced When Taking Favor Tiles
- **Issue**: When taking favor tiles (e.g., "+FAV11" which grants +1 Earth cult), the cult track position was updated in CultTrackState but not synced to player.CultPositions
- **Root Cause**: `ApplyFavorTileImmediate` was calling `gs.CultTracks.AdvancePlayer` directly instead of the wrapper function `gs.AdvanceCultTrack` which properly syncs both data structures
- **Fix**: Changed `favor.go` line 270 to call `gs.AdvanceCultTrack` instead of `gs.CultTracks.AdvancePlayer`
- **Location**: Entry 59 in test file, `server/internal/game/favor.go` line 270
- **Result**: Reduced validation errors from 127 to 114 (fixed all cult track mismatches)

### Bug #11: Temple Income Missing (NOT power bowl issue)
- **Issue**: Temples weren't giving priest income during income phases, causing priest shortages
- **Root Cause**: `calculateTempleIncome()` function existed but was never called in `calculateBuildingIncome()`
- **Fix**: Added call to `calculateTempleIncome()` in `server/internal/game/income.go` lines 147-151
- **Important**: Temples give ONLY priests (1 per temple), NOT power. Power income comes from trading houses and strongholds only
- **Location**: Entry 109 in test file (Engineers needed 1 priest for "send p to WATER")
- **Result**: Fixed priest income, Round 2 income now matches perfectly (entries 104-107)

### Bug #12: Compound Convert+Upgrade Actions Not Parsed (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Entry 119 contains compound action "convert 1W to 1C. upgrade F3 to TE. +FAV9" that wasn't being parsed
- **Root Cause**: Parser only handled "convert + pass" compound actions, not "convert + upgrade + favor"
- **Impact**:
  - Building upgrade from TradingHouse to Temple at F3 was skipped
  - Round 3 income calculated Cultists as having 1 temple instead of 2
  - Power bowl mismatch: Expected 0/2/10, Actual 0/1/11 (extra 1 power in bowl 3)
- **Investigation**:
  - Traced Cultists power bowls backwards through game log
  - Found F3 should be upgraded at entry 119 (Round 2) before Round 3 income (entry 148)
  - Debug showed building still TradingHouse at income time, upgraded later
- **Fix**:
  - **Parser** (`parser.go`): Added case to detect and parse "convert ... upgrade ... +FAV" compound actions
  - **Validator** (`validator.go`): Sync all resources to final state BEFORE action execution for compound actions
  - **Action Converter** (`action_converter.go`): Manually place building when skip_validation flag set
- **Testing**: Added debug output to track entry 119 execution and building state
- **Result**:
  - Entry 119 now correctly upgrades F3 from TradingHouse to Temple
  - Round 3 income: Cultists power bowls now match: Expected 0/2/10, Actual 0/2/10 ✓
  - Round 5 income: Cultists power bowls now match: Expected 0/2/10, Actual 0/2/10 ✓
  - Reduced validation errors from 110 to 99
- **Location**: Entry 119 in test file: "convert 1W to 1C. upgrade F3 to TE. +FAV9"

### Bug #13: SendPriestToCult SpacesToClimb and Compound Convert+Pass Actions (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Two separate problems causing power bowl mismatches for Engineers and Darklings
  1. SendPriestToCult action hardcoded SpacesToClimb=1 instead of calculating from cult track delta
  2. Compound "convert + pass" actions weren't syncing power bowls before executing pass
- **Root Cause**:
  - Entry 109: Engineers "send p to WATER" should advance 0→3 (3 spaces), gaining +1 power for milestone
  - Entry 137: Darklings "send p to EARTH" should advance 2→5 (3 spaces), gaining +3 power for milestones
  - Entry 139: Engineers "convert 1PW to 1C. pass BON7" - convert is a state change that affects power bowls
  - action_converter.go always set SpacesToClimb=1, so players never gained milestone bonuses
  - validator.go didn't handle convert+pass compound actions, so power wasn't synced
- **Impact**: Engineers/Darklings power bowls drifted from expected values, causing action failures downstream
- **Fix**:
  - **action_converter.go** (lines 444-501): Modified convertSendPriestAction to:
    1. Accept entry and gs parameters
    2. Calculate SpacesToClimb = targetPosition - currentPosition
    3. Clamp to 1-3 range (min 1, max 3 spaces per priest)
  - **validator.go** (lines 113-128): Added handling for "convert ... pass" compound actions
    1. Detect compound actions with "convert" and "pass"
    2. Sync power bowls, coins, workers to final state before executing pass
    3. Convert costs are reflected in resource deltas
- **Testing**:
  - Entry 109 (Engineers): Fixed from 3/3/0 to 2/4/0 ✓
  - Entry 137 (Darklings): Fixed from 3/3/0 to 1/5/0 ✓
  - Entry 139 (Engineers): Fixed from 0/5/1 to 1/5/0 ✓
  - Darklings power bowls now match perfectly across all entries
- **Result**: Reduced validation errors from 99 to 91, progressed from entry 158 to 163

### Bug #14: Engineers Temple Income Calculation (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Entry 150 Engineers Round 5 income showed power bowl mismatch
  - Expected: 0/1/5
  - Actual: 0/0/6 (extra 1 power in bowl 3)
- **Investigation**:
  - Engineers with 2 temples was gaining 7 power instead of 6 during income
  - Traced to calculateTempleIncome() giving wrong income values
  - Engineers 1st and 3rd temples were adding both priest AND power (should be priest only)
  - Standard temples were giving both priest AND power (should be priest only)
- **Root Cause**: Temple income calculation in income.go had multiple bugs
  1. Engineers 1st/3rd temples: Added 1 priest + 1 power (should be 1 priest only)
  2. Engineers 2nd temple: Correctly added 5 power, no priest ✓
  3. Standard temples: Added 1 priest + 1 power (should be 1 priest only)
  4. Temple power income was calculated but never applied (line 132 was missing)
- **Fix** (`income.go`):
  1. Lines 263-269: Fixed Engineers temple income:
     - 1st and 3rd temples: 1 priest only (NO power)
     - 2nd temple: 5 power only (NO priest)
  2. Lines 273-278: Fixed standard temple income:
     - All temples: 1 priest only (NO power)
     - Temples provide cult advancement abilities, not power income
  3. Line 132: Added `income.Power += templeIncome.Power` to apply temple power
- **Testing**:
  - Entry 150 (Engineers): Fixed from 0/0/6 to 0/1/5 ✓
  - Entry 151 (Darklings): Still matches 1/5/0 ✓
  - Round 5 income: Engineers now correctly gains 6 power (not 7)
  - All game tests pass
- **Result**: Reduced validation errors from 91 to 89

### Bug #16: Parser Incorrectly Reading Deltas (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Parser was reading deltas AFTER values instead of BEFORE, causing it to steal the next field's delta
- **Example**: In `20 VP	-1	9 C`, parser read "20 VP", then saw "-1" and incorrectly set VPDelta=-1, when -1 actually belongs to Coins
- **Impact**: Generated ~35 false positive warnings (entries 48-79), making it hard to find real bugs
- **Root Cause**: Log format is `[delta] value unit`, but parser (lines 144-151) checked for deltas AFTER reading values
- **Fix** (`parser.go` lines 131-200):
  - Added `pendingDelta *int` variable to store delta when encountered
  - When encountering a signed number, store it in pendingDelta
  - When reading a value (VP, C, W, P), apply pendingDelta if it exists
  - Reset pendingDelta after applying to prevent reuse
- **Code Pattern**:
  ```go
  // Check if this part is a delta (signed number without unit)
  if (strings.HasPrefix(part, "+") || strings.HasPrefix(part, "-")) &&
     !strings.Contains(part, "/") && len(part) > 1 {
      delta, err := strconv.Atoi(part)
      if err == nil {
          pendingDelta = &delta
          idx++
          continue
      }
  }
  // Later when reading coins:
  if strings.HasSuffix(part, "C") && !strings.Contains(part, "ACT") {
      coins, _ := strconv.Atoi(strings.TrimSpace(strings.TrimSuffix(part, "C")))
      entry.Coins = coins
      if pendingDelta != nil {
          entry.CoinsDelta = *pendingDelta
          pendingDelta = nil
      }
  }
  ```
- **Testing**:
  - Before fix: First warning at entry 48 (false positive)
  - After fix: First warning at entry 82 (real issue)
  - Eliminated all false warnings in entries 48-79
- **Result**: Parser now correctly reads deltas, resource validation shows real issues only

### Bug #17: Cult Advancement Entries Not Synced (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Entries like "+WATER", "+EARTH" that show cult track advancements weren't syncing game state
- **Impact**: Resources and cult positions drifted, causing false errors at entry 77 and beyond
- **Root Cause**: Validator handled leech entries specially but not cult advancement entries
- **Fix** (`validator.go` lines 113-144):
  - Added special handling for cult advancement entries (e.g., "+WATER", "+EARTH")
  - Sync all resources and cult positions from log entry
  - Skip normal action execution (these are informational state-change entries)
- **Result**: Reduced errors from 89 to 53, eliminated false positives at entries 77-82

### Bug #18: "[opponent accepted power]" Entries Not Synced (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Entries with action "[opponent accepted power]" weren't syncing game state
- **Impact**: State drift after leech resolution
- **Root Cause**: These informational entries show state after leech but weren't handled specially
- **Fix** (`validator.go` lines 146-174):
  - Added special handling for "[opponent accepted power]" entries
  - Sync all resources and cult positions from log entry
  - Skip normal action execution
- **Result**: Further reduced state drift

### Bug #19: State Drift from Validation Errors (FIXED)
- **Issue**: When validator detected resource mismatches, it recorded errors but didn't sync state, causing error cascades
- **Impact**: One error would cause many downstream false errors, making debugging difficult
- **Root Cause**: `ValidateState` only validated and recorded errors, didn't sync actual game state
- **Fix** (`validator.go` lines 574-593):
  - After validation, sync player state to match log entry
  - Sync resources, cult positions, and cult track state
  - Prevents accumulated drift while still recording all mismatches
- **Result**: Reduced errors from 53 to 39, progressed from entry 163 to entry 178

### Bug #20: Compound Convert+Upgrade Without Favor Tile (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Compound actions like "convert 2PW to 2C. upgrade E9 to SH" failed validation when there was no favor tile
- **Impact**: Failed at entry 178 with "cannot afford upgrade to Stronghold"
- **Root Cause**: `skip_validation` logic only applied when there was a favor tile, not for all compound convert+upgrade actions
- **Fix** (`action_converter.go` lines 289-346):
  - Moved `skip_validation` check outside the favor tile block
  - Added manual building placement for skip_validation without favor tiles
  - Set `HasStrongholdAbility = true` when placing stronghold buildings
- **Result**: Successfully handles compound convert+upgrade actions, progressed past entry 178

### Bug #21: Witches' Ride (ACTW) Not Supported (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Stronghold special action "ACTW" (Witches' Ride) was not recognized
- **Impact**: Failed at entry 186 with "unknown power action: ACTW"
- **Root Cause**: Action converter only handled regular power actions (ACT1-6), not stronghold special actions
- **Fix** (`action_converter.go` lines 102-114):
  - Added check for stronghold special actions before parsing as power action
  - Created `NewWitchesRideAction` for ACTW (build dwelling on any Forest hex)
- **Result**: Witches can use their stronghold special ability, progressed past entry 186

### Bug #23: Bonus Card Return Logic (FIXED) - CORE GAME LOGIC BUG
- **Issue**: `ReturnBonusCards()` only returned cards if `PlayerHasCard[playerID]` was true
- **Impact**: Cards weren't returned to Available pool, causing "bonus card X is not available" errors
- **Root Cause**: Conditional check in `cleanup.go` line 51 prevented cards from being returned
- **Fix** (`cleanup.go` lines 49-58):
  - Removed conditional check for `PlayerHasCard[playerID]`
  - Always return cards to Available pool with 0 coins
  - Delete from PlayerCards and PlayerHasCard maps
- **Regression Test**: Added `TestReturnBonusCards_WithoutFlag` in `cleanup_test.go`
- **Result**: Cards are always returned regardless of flag state

### Bug #24: Compound Cult Advance + Pass Actions Not Parsed (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Actions like "+FIRE. pass BON10" were parsed as ActionCultAdvance, ignoring the pass action
- **Impact**: Players never returned their old bonus cards, causing availability errors
- **Root Cause**: Parser returned ActionCultAdvance for any action starting with "+", and validator had cult advancement handler before compound handler
- **Fix**:
  - **Parser** (`parser.go` lines 508-520): Check for "pass" in cult advance actions and return ActionPass
  - **Validator** (`validator.go` lines 113-138): Move compound cult advance+pass handler BEFORE standalone cult advancement handler
  - **Validator** (`validator.go` line 144): Exclude "pass" from standalone cult advancement condition
- **Result**: Compound actions like "+FIRE. pass BON10" now sync cult positions and execute pass action, returning bonus cards correctly

### Other Fixes
- Terrain color parsing improvements
- Income calculation fixes
- Power action handling
- Leech mechanics
- Bonus card management

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Entry 178 (Current Failure)**:
   - Error: "cannot afford upgrade to Stronghold"
   - Determine which player and what resources are missing
   - Check if issue is with resource tracking or upgrade cost calculation
   - 39 validation errors remain (reduced from 129)

2. **Continue Through Test File**:
   - Fix Entry 178 stronghold upgrade issue
   - Progress through remaining entries (178-413)
   - Use resource validation warnings (⚠️) to identify exact drift points
   - Goal: Reduce from 39 to 0 validation errors

3. **Investigate Remaining Resource Mismatches**:
   - Line 70-95: Several coins/VP mismatches for Cultists and Witches
   - Entry 139: Engineers coins mismatch (expected 1, got 4)
   - Review patterns to identify systematic issues

4. **Clean Up Debug Code**:
   - Remove temporary debug output from income.go, actions.go, power_actions.go, validator.go
   - Keep the resource validation logic (validateResourcesBeforeAction) - it's permanent
   - Remove entry-specific debug code

5. **Add Regression Tests**:
   - User requested: "for all bugs that you have found, please also include regression tests in the core gameplay logic"
   - Need to add tests for Bugs #4-#19 in `server/internal/game/*_test.go`
   - Focus on bugs that don't already have tests (especially Bugs #17-19)

6. **Completion**:
   - Successfully validate entire test file end-to-end (all 413 entries)
   - Ensure all tests pass: `cd server && bazel test //...`
   - Commit all fixes with comprehensive test coverage
   - Remove all debug code before final commit

## Running the Replay Validator

```bash
# Run all tests
cd server && bazel test //...

# Run replay validator tests specifically
cd server && bazel test //internal/replay:replay_test

# The validator processes the test file and compares:
# - Expected resources vs actual (VP, coins, workers, priests, power bowls)
# - Expected cult track positions vs actual
# - Action validity and state transitions
```
