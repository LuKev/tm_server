# Phase 4: Faction System - Progress

## Phase 4.1: Base Faction Interface ✅

### Completed Components

#### 1. Core Faction Interface (`faction.go`)
- ✅ **Faction interface** with all required methods
- ✅ **BaseFaction** struct providing default implementations
- ✅ **Resources** struct for tracking faction resources (coins, workers, priests, power)
- ✅ **Cost** struct for action costs
- ✅ **SpecialAbility** enum for unique faction abilities

#### 2. Standard Costs and Mechanics
- ✅ Standard building costs (Dwelling, TP, Temple, Sanctuary, Stronghold)
- ✅ Standard shipping costs (4 coins, 1 priest per level)
- ✅ Standard digging costs (5 workers, 2 coins per level)
- ✅ Terraform cost calculation (3 workers/spade, reduced by digging level)
- ✅ Bridge cost (3 workers standard, can be overridden by Engineers)

#### 3. Helper Functions
- ✅ `CanAfford()` - Check if resources are sufficient
- ✅ `Subtract()` - Deduct costs from resources
- ✅ `Add()` - Combine resources

#### 4. Faction Registry (`registry.go`)
- ✅ Registry system for managing all factions
- ✅ `Get()` - Retrieve faction by type
- ✅ `GetAll()` - Get all factions
- ✅ `GetByTerrain()` - Filter factions by home terrain
- ✅ Standard starting resources helper

#### 5. Tests (`faction_test.go`)
- ✅ 10 test cases covering:
  - Basic faction properties
  - Terraform cost calculation
  - Building costs
  - Resource management (CanAfford, Subtract, Add)
  - Registry operations
  - Terrain filtering

### Files Created
1. `server/internal/game/factions/faction.go` - Core interface and base implementation
2. `server/internal/game/factions/registry.go` - Faction registry system
3. `server/internal/game/factions/BUILD.bazel` - Bazel build configuration
4. `server/internal/game/factions/faction_test.go` - Comprehensive tests
5. `server/internal/game/factions/FACTION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide

### Test Results
✅ **All 10 tests passing**

## Phase 4.2: Individual Faction Implementations

### Ready to Implement (14 factions)

#### Yellow (Desert)
- [ ] **Nomads** - Sandstorm ability
- [ ] **Fakirs** - Carpet flying

#### Red (Wasteland)
- [ ] **Chaos Magicians** - Favor tile transformation
- [ ] **Giants** - Reduced terraform costs

#### Blue (Lake)
- [ ] **Swarmlings** - Cheap dwellings
- [ ] **Mermaids** - Water building, town bonuses

#### Green (Forest)
- [ ] **Witches** - Flying
- [ ] **Auren** - Favor tile benefits

#### Brown (Plains)
- [ ] **Halflings** - Spade efficiency
- [ ] **Cultists** - Cult track bonuses

#### Black (Swamp)
- [ ] **Alchemists** - Conversion efficiency
- [ ] **Darklings** - Priest benefits

#### Gray (Mountain)
- [ ] **Engineers** - Bridge building
- [ ] **Dwarves** - Tunnel digging

## Implementation Strategy

We'll implement factions in order of complexity:

### Tier 1: Simple (Stat Modifications)
1. **Giants** - Just reduced terraform costs
2. **Swarmlings** - Just reduced dwelling costs
3. **Halflings** - Spade efficiency bonus

### Tier 2: Moderate (Special Actions)
4. **Nomads** - Sandstorm special action
5. **Engineers** - Reduced bridge costs
6. **Cultists** - Cult track bonuses
7. **Alchemists** - Conversion bonuses
8. **Darklings** - Priest bonuses
9. **Auren** - Favor tile enhancements

### Tier 3: Complex (Unique Mechanics)
10. **Fakirs** - Carpet flying (adjacency bypass)
11. **Witches** - Flying (adjacency bypass)
12. **Mermaids** - Water building + town bonuses
13. **Chaos Magicians** - Favor tile transformation
14. **Dwarves** - Tunnel digging (virtual adjacency)

## Next Steps

Ready to implement individual factions! We can start with the simpler ones (Giants, Swarmlings, Halflings) and work our way up to the more complex mechanics.

Each faction will need:
1. Faction struct embedding BaseFaction
2. Constructor with proper starting resources
3. Override methods for special abilities
4. Stronghold ability implementation
5. Unit tests
