# Phase 4: Faction System - Progress

## Phase 4.1: Base Faction Interface ✅

### Completed Components

#### 1. Core Faction Interface (`faction.go`)
- ✅ **Faction interface** with all required methods
- ✅ **BaseFaction** struct providing default implementations
- ✅ **Resources** struct for tracking faction resources (coins, workers, priests, power)
- ✅ **Cost** struct for action costs
- ✅ **SpecialAbility** enum for unique faction abilities

#### 2. Standard Costs and Mechanics
- ✅ Standard building costs (Dwelling, TP, Temple, Sanctuary, Stronghold)
- ✅ Standard shipping costs (4 coins, 1 priest per level)
- ✅ Standard digging costs (5 workers, 2 coins per level)
- ✅ Terraform cost calculation (3 workers/spade, reduced by digging level)
- ✅ Bridge cost (3 workers standard, can be overridden by Engineers)

#### 3. Helper Functions
- ✅ `CanAfford()` - Check if resources are sufficient
- ✅ `Subtract()` - Deduct costs from resources
- ✅ `Add()` - Combine resources

#### 4. Faction Registry (`registry.go`)
- ✅ Registry system for managing all factions
- ✅ `Get()` - Retrieve faction by type
- ✅ `GetAll()` - Get all factions
- ✅ `GetByTerrain()` - Filter factions by home terrain
- ✅ Standard starting resources helper

#### 5. Tests (`faction_test.go`)
- ✅ 10 test cases covering:
  - Basic faction properties
  - Terraform cost calculation
  - Building costs
  - Resource management (CanAfford, Subtract, Add)
  - Registry operations
  - Terrain filtering

### Files Created
1. `server/internal/game/factions/faction.go` - Core interface and base implementation
2. `server/internal/game/factions/registry.go` - Faction registry system
3. `server/internal/game/factions/BUILD.bazel` - Bazel build configuration
4. `server/internal/game/factions/faction_test.go` - Comprehensive tests
5. `server/internal/game/factions/FACTION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide

### Test Results
✅ **All base tests passing**

## Phase 4.2: Individual Faction Implementations

### Completed (14/14 factions - 100%) ✅

#### Green (Forest)
- [x] **Witches** - +5 VP for towns, Witches' Ride special action
- [x] **Auren** - Favor tile on stronghold, cult advance special action

#### Brown (Plains)
- [x] **Halflings** - +1 VP per spade, 3 spades from stronghold, cheaper digging, expensive stronghold
- [x] **Cultists** - Cult advance from power leech, 7 VP from stronghold, expensive sanctuary/stronghold

#### Black (Swamp)
- [x] **Alchemists** - VP/Coin conversion, 12 power + 2 power/spade after stronghold
- [x] **Darklings** - Priests for terraform (2 VP/spade), expensive sanctuary, cannot upgrade digging

#### Gray (Mountain)
- [x] **Engineers** - Cheaper bridge (2 workers), 3 VP per bridge on pass, cheaper buildings
- [x] **Dwarves** - Tunneling (skip space for workers + 4 VP), no shipping, reduced cost after stronghold

#### Red (Wasteland)
- [x] **Chaos Magicians** - 2 favor tiles for Temple/Sanctuary, double-turn special action, start with 1 dwelling
- [x] **Giants** - Always 2 spades to terraform, 2 free spades special action after stronghold

#### Blue (Lake)
- [x] **Swarmlings** - +3 workers for towns, free TP upgrade after stronghold, expensive buildings
- [x] **Mermaids** - Skip river for town, free shipping after stronghold, start at shipping 1, max shipping 5

#### Yellow (Desert)
- [x] **Nomads** - Start with 3 dwellings, Sandstorm special action after stronghold
- [x] **Fakirs** - Carpet flight (skip spaces for priests + 4 VP), range increases with stronghold/shipping town

## Summary

**Phase 4 Complete!** All 14 factions fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage.

### Total Test Coverage
- **166 test cases** across all factions
- All tests passing ✅
- Comprehensive coverage of:
  - Starting resources and special costs
  - Special abilities and mechanics
  - Stronghold abilities
  - Faction-specific restrictions
  - Resource management

### Key Implementation Notes
- All factions have phase dependency comments linking to future phases
- Special mechanics documented for Phase 6.2 (Action System) integration
- Power system dependencies noted for Phase 5.1
- Cult track, favor tiles, and town tiles dependencies noted for Phase 7.x
- VP tracking dependencies noted for Phase 8

### Ready for Next Phase
With all 14 factions implemented, the codebase is ready to move forward with:
- Phase 5: Power System
- Phase 6: Action System
- Phase 7: Cult Tracks, Favor Tiles, Town Tiles
- Phase 8: Scoring System
